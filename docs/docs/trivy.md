* --vuln-type: list of severity levels to report  (default "CRITICAL")
* --db-repository: repository to use for the trivy vulnerability database (default "ghcr.io/aquasecurity/trivy-db")
* --delete-scan-failed-images : boolean to delete images for which scanning has failed (default true)

 The following arguments can be used to specify timeouts for the trivy scanner:
 
* --image-scan-timeout: duration for timeout for each of the images scanned (default 1h)
* --image-scan-total-timeout: duration for timeout for total scan job (default 23h)

For duration, valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "Âµs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h".
